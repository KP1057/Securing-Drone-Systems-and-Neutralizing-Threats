# -Securing-Drone-Systems-and-Neutralizing-Threats
Step1:Decode the sample raw file using the requiremnts.txt,using the command"pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
Step2:./src/droneid_receiver_offline.py -i samples/mini2_sm
Step3:Copy the decoded file and use the encryotion code to encrypt it.
Step4:Save the key 
Step5:Use the key in the decryption code decrypt the data.
Here we have found a major vulnerability in the drone data tramission and we a have proposed a proper solution to solve that vulnerability.
Later the key can be saved in a hybrid cloud to avoid further complications.
